# Iris
### Basic classification model for the Iris species, study case to apply ML models with Sklearn

Supervised learning model implementation to predict Iris species through their Sepal and Petal lenght and with, with 4 features, 1 target and 150 rows.

* `Iris.py` - modelling with all features to predict.
* `iris_petalo.py` - modelling only with Petal features.
* `iris_sepalo.py` - modelling only with Sepal features.
